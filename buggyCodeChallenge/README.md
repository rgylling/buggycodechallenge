### Super Buggy Code Challenge!

If you're reading this it means that this project has escaped un-de-bugged. Please Remove all errors so that the ```<p>```  output matches the ```<h1>``` target in the html as ASAP as possible. Document your errors and bugs that you find, and make a list of what you did to fix it. Make thorough comments, and submit a link to a forked version of this folder to get +1 Extra Credit point per bug (up to 10pts.)

(Hint: moving things around will be a main help. You should only need to change//add a few variable names, function calls, or other content-specific issues.)
